This table should help you compare the features and limitations of each API to make an informed decision based on your specific needs.

**1. Webz.io News API Lite**

[Webz.io News API Lite](https://webz.io/products/news-api#lite) offers an accessible entry point into one of the world's largest repositories of global news data. Designed for those with non-commercial projects, this API serves as a valuable resource for students, developers, and researchers who require high-quality news data without the financial burden typically associated with such extensive resources.

With global coverage that spans over 170 languages, the News API Lite allows users to search millions of articles, offering up to 30 days of historical data. This capability is particularly beneficial for those conducting trend analysis, academic research, or developing innovative applications where current and recent news is pivotal.

One of the standout features of the Webz.io News API Lite is its powerful search functionality. Users can refine their searches with Boolean queries, sentiment analysis, and a variety of filters, ensuring that they can pinpoint the exact data they need. This level of sophistication, typically reserved for more costly platforms, makes the API Lite a unique offering in the market.

The onboarding process is remarkably straightforward, requiring only an email and an API key to get started. This ease of access underscores Webz.io's commitment to supporting the wider community by lowering the barriers to entry for accessing comprehensive news data.

However, it's important to note that the free tier of the API comes with limitations. Users are restricted to 1,000 calls per month, with a maximum of 10 articles returned per call. While these constraints may not suffice for large-scale commercial projects, they are more than adequate for the intended audience of non-commercial users.

Overall, the Webz.io News API Lite is a well-crafted solution that balances accessibility with functionality, offering a rare opportunity to tap into a vast news database at no cost.
